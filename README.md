🧠 Mask Detection Using Autoencoders
This project implements a mask detection system using an unsupervised learning technique called Autoencoders. The model is trained only on masked face images, learning to reconstruct them well. At test time, images with no masks (unseen variations) result in higher reconstruction errors, allowing us to distinguish masked vs. unmasked faces using a threshold.

📌 Features
Autoencoder-based anomaly detection.

Contractive loss for robust feature learning.

Visualizes reconstruction and reconstruction errors.

Automatically computes classification accuracy.

Lightweight and interpretable architecture.

🚀 How It Works
Train the Autoencoder using only images of people wearing masks.

The model learns to reconstruct these masked faces with low error.

During testing, both masked and unmasked images are passed through the model.

Unmasked faces result in higher reconstruction errors.

A threshold (set from the training error distribution) is used for classification.
